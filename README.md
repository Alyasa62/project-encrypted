It is a simple C++ OOP project. 
it can take your messages/notes and will save it as an encrypted file.

1. It will take your file name.
2. It will take your data in text form.
3. It will take an encryption key from you.
4. It will encrypt your data with that key using an XNOR gate.
5. It will save your file in an encrypted form.

When you will open that file it wil be encrypted. When you give it a wrong key it will be encrypted. You can only access that file with right encryprion key.
